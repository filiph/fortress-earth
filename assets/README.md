To construct the map using `tool/parse_map.dart`, you'll need an input image file.

Download it from 
[Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-raster-data/10m-natural-earth-1/), 
for example.

Then follow instructions in `tool/parse_map.dart`.

Or just use `make` in the root  and it will download the default set for you 
and will run the tool.
