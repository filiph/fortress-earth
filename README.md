# Fortress Earth



## Development

### Initial setup

1. Make sure you have Dart installed.
2. Run `make`. This will download supporting assets and will build the terrain data file.

### Day-to-day development

1. Either use an IntelliJ IDE with the Dart plugin, or use Dart's 
   [`webdev serve`](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/webdev) tool.
